## 🚀 New Scarcity Projections

### Conservative ($100M TVL)
```
Year 1: 80M VEIL burned (8% supply)
- 60M from burn-to-earn (1.5x bonus)
- 15M from vault fees
- 5M from buyback

Year 3: 300M burned (30% supply)
→ +43% price from scarcity

Year 5: 550M burned (55% supply)
→ +222% price from scarcity
```

### Aggressive ($1B TVL)
```
Year 1: 280M VEIL burned (28% supply)
- 220M from burn-to-earn (1.5x bonus)
- 40M from vault fees
- 20M from buyback

Year 3: 650M burned (65% supply)
→ +286% price from scarcity

Year 5: 850M burned (85% supply)
→ +1,233% price from scarcity
```

## 💎 Yield Scenarios with veVEIL Boost

### Without veVEIL (Base)
```
Burn 100,000 VEIL → 150,000 Immortal Shares (1.5x bonus)
At $1B TVL: 15% APY = 22,500 USDC/year
```

### With veVEIL (Max Boost)
```
Burn 100,000 VEIL → 150,000 Immortal Shares
Lock 100,000 VEIL for 4 years → 100,000 veVEIL
Boost: 2.5x

Yield: 15% × 2.5 = 37.5% APY = 56,250 USDC/year
```

**Difference: +150% yield for locking**

## 🏆 Why This is Now Top-Tier

### 1. Strongest Deflation in DeFi
```
Multiple burn mechanisms:
- Burn-to-earn (voluntary)
- Vault fees (automatic)
- Buyback engine (continuous)

Combined: 850M+ VEIL burned in 5 years at $1B TVL
```

### 2. Best Risk-Adjusted Yield
```
Base: 15% APY in USDC (real yield)
Boosted: 37.5% APY with veVEIL lock
No impermanent loss
No liquidation risk
```

### 3. Perfect Incentive Alignment
```
Burn → Get yield
Lock → Boost yield
Hold → Price appreciation
Participate → Earn more

Everyone wins when protocol succeeds
```

### 4. Transparent & Fair
```
All allocations public
Vesting enforced on-chain
No hidden unlocks
Community-first distribution
```

## 📈 5-Year Price Projection

### Assumptions
- $1B TVL maintained
- 70% of supply burned
- Market cap = 3x TVL (DeFi average)

### Calculation
```
Initial: 1B VEIL × $0.50 = $500M market cap
Year 5: 300M VEIL × $10 = $3B market cap

Price: $0.50 → $10 (+1,900%)
```

### Conservative (50% burned)
```
500M VEIL × $6 = $3B market cap
Price: $0.50 → $6 (+1,100%)
```
