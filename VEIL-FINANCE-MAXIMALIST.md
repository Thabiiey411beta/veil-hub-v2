# 🌑 Veil Finance – Pure, Unregulated, Maximalist DeFi Organism

**Built 100% on Supra L1. Zero compliance. Zero KYC. Zero off-chain partners. Zero RWA hand-holding.**

Only crypto-native, over-collateralized, privacy-first money legos that generate real yield forever.

## Core Rule

**Every single satoshi of profit stays on-chain, gets paid in USDC/ETH/BTC, and flows to $VEIL holders through burn + perpetual dividends.**

---

## Final Stack (100% Supra L1 Native)

### 1. Ghost Borrowing
**Zero-liquidation, fixed 5.5% APR USDC loans**
- 180% → 120% auto-repay
- Collateral: ETH, wstETH, cbBTC, WBTC
- All deposits via ZK-private Ghost Vaults (Nocturne-style)

**Real Yield:** 5.5% borrow interest (crypto-native spread)

**$VEIL Wins:**
- 40% of interest → buy $VEIL & burn
- 40% → Immortal Reserve (USDC dividends)
- 20% → veVEIL stakers

### 2. Delta-Neutral Yield Engine
**Protocol runs fully on-chain basis trades:**
- Borrow USDC @ 5.5%
- Buy LSTs (wstETH, cbETH)
- Short exact amount on Veil Perpetual DEX
- Capture perpetual funding rate

**Real Yield:** Positive funding on ETH/BTC perps (+8–25% APR)

**$VEIL Wins:** Entire net spread (6–18% real) → 100% to Immortal Reserve as USDC dividends

### 3. Veil Perpetual DEX
**Privacy-first perps (ZK-private positions)**
- Sub-second Supra oracles
- Zero oracle lag attacks
- 5 bps trading fee

**Real Yield:** 5 bps on $10B+ notional = massive revenue

**$VEIL Wins:** 100% of all perp fees → market buy & burn $VEIL

### 4. Ghost Vaults (ERC-4626)
**Auto-compounding strategies (all ZK-private):**
- ETH delta-neutral
- BTC basis trades
- Leveraged LSTs

**Real Yield:** 15–40%+ strategy APR in bull markets

**$VEIL Wins:** 15% performance fee → 75% burned as $VEIL, 25% to Immortal Reserve

### 5. Shadow Gas (Privacy Tax)
**Every private action costs Shadow Gas:**
- Deposit, borrow, trade, withdraw
- 1 $VEIL burned → 120,000 Shadow Gas
- 90-day expiry

**Real Yield:** Scales 1:1 with usage

**$VEIL Wins:** 100% hard burn — more privacy = more $VEIL disappears

---

## The Three Pure Earning Loops

### Loop 1: Borrow → Delta-Neutral → Immortal Dividends
1. Users borrow USDC cheap (5.5%)
2. Protocol uses USDC for delta-neutral LST/perp trades (12–25%)
3. Net profit → perpetual USDC dividends to Immortal + veVEIL holders
4. Borrow interest → buy & burn $VEIL

**Result:** Users earn real yield, protocol earns spread, $VEIL gets burned

### Loop 2: Trade Private Perps → Burn $VEIL
1. Whales trade billions on only truly private perps venue
2. 5 bps fee (tiny for user, massive at scale)
3. 100% of fees → market-buy and burn $VEIL

**Result:** Traders keep profits, $VEIL supply evaporates

### Loop 3: Use Privacy → Burn $VEIL
1. Every private transaction burns Shadow Gas ($VEIL)
2. At $2B+ TVL with 10x yearly turnover → 100M+ $VEIL burned/year
3. More privacy usage = more burns

**Result:** The more people hide, the richer $VEIL holders get

## Final Tokenomics

**Hard-Cap: 1,000,000,000 $VEIL (Designed to go to Zero Supply)**

| Allocation | % | Notes |
|------------|---|-------|
| Immortal Reserve | 30% | Burn-to-earn (progressive bonus) |
| Team | 15% | 4-year vest + 1-year cliff |
| Treasury (DAO) | 20% | Liquidity + Supra grants only |
| Liquidity / LP | 20% | Locked forever or vested |
| Community / Growth | 15% | Airdrops to early burners & veVEIL |

## Realistic Numbers (Pure Math on Supra L1)

### Conservative: $500M TVL + $3B Perp Volume
- **Yearly USDC Yield:** 18–28% APR
- **Yearly $VEIL Burn:** 120–180M (12–18% supply)

### Moderate: $1.5B TVL + $10B Perp Volume
- **Yearly USDC Yield:** 22–35% APR
- **Yearly $VEIL Burn:** 280–380M (28–38% supply)

### Aggressive: $5B TVL + $30B Perp Volume
- **Yearly USDC Yield:** 25–45% APR
- **Yearly $VEIL Burn:** 600M+ (60%+ supply gone in <4 years)
